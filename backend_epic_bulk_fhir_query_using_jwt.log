                     EPIC BULK FHIR DATA EXPORT TUTORIAL                        
================================================================================

This script demonstrates the Epic Bulk FHIR Data Export process using JWT
authentication. It will walk through each step of the process, explaining the
technical details and showing the actual data involved.

STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
--------------------
Before we begin, we need to set up our environment:
• Clear previous export files
• Initialize logging
• Load configuration

                        EPIC FHIR BULK DATA EXPORT TUTORIAL                      
================================================================================

STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
--------------------
Preparing environment for bulk data export...
• Export Directory: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\epic_data_export
• Action: Clearing previous export files
• Found 0 files to remove
• Successfully cleared all existing files

STEP 2: JWT CREATION AND SIGNING
---------------------------
The JWT (JSON Web Token) is created with the following structure:

Header:
  {
    "alg": "RS384",
    "typ": "JWT"
  }

Claims:
  {
    "iss": "e6adc0f2-7e22-4a86-9f11-5b8bae6e5190",
    "sub": [same as iss],
    "aud": [token endpoint],
    "jti": [unique identifier],
    "exp": [expiration time],
    "iat": [issued at time]
  }

The JWT is signed using:
• Algorithm: RS384
• Key Size: 2048 bits
• Private Key: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\private.key
• Public Key: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\publickey509.pem


STEP 3: OAUTH 2.0 TOKEN EXCHANGE
-----------------------------
The signed JWT is exchanged for an access token using:
• Epic Base URL:
  https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/
• OAuth Token Endpoint:
  https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/oauth2/token
• Client ID:
  e6adc0f2-7e22-4a86-9f11-5b8bae6e5190

Request Parameters:
  {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_assertion_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer",
    "client_assertion": [signed JWT]
  }

• Saving to: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\epic_data_export\Observation.ndjson


STEP 6: DATA ANALYSIS
-------------------
After downloading the bulk data, we:
1. Parse the NDJSON files
2. Analyze observation data
3. Generate a summary report
4. Save results to the export directory

The observation report includes:
• Reference ranges for vital signs
• Normal vs abnormal readings
• Patient-specific statistics

================================================================================
                               PROCESS COMPLETE                                  
================================================================================

Summary:
• Successfully authenticated using JWT
• Completed bulk FHIR data export
• Downloaded and processed resource data
• Generated observation analysis report

All files can be found in:
  C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\epic_data_export

                     EPIC BULK FHIR DATA EXPORT TUTORIAL                        
================================================================================

This script demonstrates the Epic Bulk FHIR Data Export process using JWT
authentication. It will walk through each step of the process, explaining the
technical details and showing the actual data involved.

STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
--------------------
Before we begin, we need to set up our environment:
• Clear previous export files
• Initialize logging
• Load configuration

================================================================================
                        EPIC FHIR BULK DATA EXPORT TUTORIAL                      
================================================================================

STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
--------------------
Preparing environment for bulk data export...
• Export Directory: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\epic_data_export
• Action: Clearing previous export files
• Found 6 files to remove
• Successfully cleared all existing files

STEP 2: JWT CREATION AND SIGNING
---------------------------
The JWT (JSON Web Token) is created with the following structure:

Header:
  {
    "alg": "RS384",
    "typ": "JWT"
  }

Claims:
  {
    "iss": "e6adc0f2-7e22-4a86-9f11-5b8bae6e5190",
    "sub": [same as iss],
    "aud": [token endpoint],
    "jti": [unique identifier],
    "exp": [expiration time],
    "iat": [issued at time]
  }

The JWT is signed using:
• Algorithm: RS384
• Key Size: 2048 bits
• Private Key: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\private.key
• Public Key: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\publickey509.pem


STEP 3: OAUTH 2.0 TOKEN EXCHANGE
-----------------------------
The signed JWT is exchanged for an access token using:
• Epic Base URL:
  https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/
• OAuth Token Endpoint:
  https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/oauth2/token
• Client ID:
  e6adc0f2-7e22-4a86-9f11-5b8bae6e5190

Request Parameters:
  {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_assertion_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer",
    "client_assertion": [signed JWT]
  }

STEP 6: DATA ANALYSIS
-------------------
After downloading the bulk data, we:
1. Parse the NDJSON files
2. Analyze observation data
3. Generate a summary report
4. Save results to the export directory

The observation report includes:
• Reference ranges for vital signs
• Normal vs abnormal readings
• Patient-specific statistics

                               PROCESS COMPLETE                                  
================================================================================

Summary:
• Successfully authenticated using JWT
• Completed bulk FHIR data export
• Downloaded and processed resource data
• Generated observation analysis report

                     EPIC BULK FHIR DATA EXPORT TUTORIAL                        
================================================================================

This script demonstrates the Epic Bulk FHIR Data Export process using JWT
authentication. It will walk through each step of the process, explaining the
technical details and showing the actual data involved.

STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
--------------------
Before we begin, we need to set up our environment:
• Clear previous export files
• Initialize logging
• Load configuration

================================================================================
                        EPIC FHIR BULK DATA EXPORT TUTORIAL                      
================================================================================

STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
--------------------
Preparing environment for bulk data export...
• Export Directory: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\epic_data_export
• Action: Clearing previous export files
• Found 6 files to remove
• Successfully cleared all existing files

STEP 2: JWT CREATION AND SIGNING
---------------------------
The JWT (JSON Web Token) is created with the following structure:

Header:
  {
    "alg": "RS384",
    "typ": "JWT"
  }

Claims:
  {
    "iss": "e6adc0f2-7e22-4a86-9f11-5b8bae6e5190",
    "sub": [same as iss],
    "aud": [token endpoint],
    "jti": [unique identifier],
    "exp": [expiration time],
    "iat": [issued at time]
  }

The JWT is signed using:
• Algorithm: RS384
• Key Size: 2048 bits
• Private Key: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\private.key
• Public Key: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\publickey509.pem


STEP 3: OAUTH 2.0 TOKEN EXCHANGE
-----------------------------
The signed JWT is exchanged for an access token using:
• Epic Base URL:
  https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/
• OAuth Token Endpoint:
  https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/oauth2/token
• Client ID:
  e6adc0f2-7e22-4a86-9f11-5b8bae6e5190

Request Parameters:
  {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_assertion_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer",
    "client_assertion": [signed JWT]
  }
