                     EPIC BULK FHIR DATA EXPORT TUTORIAL                        
================================================================================

This script demonstrates the Epic Bulk FHIR Data Export process using JWT
authentication. It will walk through each step of the process, explaining the
technical details and showing the actual data involved.

STEP 1: INITIALIZATION
--------------------
Before we begin, we need to set up our environment:
• Clear previous export files
• Initialize logging
• Load configuration


STEP 2: JWT CREATION AND SIGNING
---------------------------
The JWT (JSON Web Token) is created with the following structure:

Header:
  {
    "alg": "RS384",
    "typ": "JWT"
  }

Claims:
  {
    "iss": "e6adc0f2-7e22-4a86-9f11-5b8bae6e5190",
    "sub": [same as iss],
    "aud": [token endpoint],
    "jti": [unique identifier],
    "exp": [expiration time],
    "iat": [issued at time]
  }

The JWT is signed using:
• Algorithm: RS384
• Key Size: 2048 bits
• Private Key: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\private.key
• Public Key: C:\FHIR\BackendEpic\publickey509.pem


STEP 3: OAUTH 2.0 TOKEN EXCHANGE
-----------------------------
The signed JWT is exchanged for an access token using:
• Epic Base URL:
  https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/
• OAuth Token Endpoint:
  https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/oauth2/token
• Client ID:
  e6adc0f2-7e22-4a86-9f11-5b8bae6e5190

Request Parameters:
  {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_assertion_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer",
    "client_assertion": [signed JWT]
  }

STEP 4: BULK FHIR DATA EXPORT
--------------------------
The Bulk FHIR Data Export process follows these steps:

1. Initiate Export:
   • Send request to Group/$export endpoint
   • Specify desired resource types
   • Receive status URL in response

2. Monitor Progress:
   • Poll status URL periodically
   • Check for completion or errors

3. Download Results:
   • Retrieve data for each resource type
   • Save as NDJSON files

Resource Types Requested:
  - Patient
  - Observation
  - Condition
  - AllergyIntolerance
  - MedicationRequest
  - Procedure

----------------------------------
The export process is asynchronous. We will:
1. Poll the status URL every 10 seconds
2. Check for completion status
3. Download each resource file when ready
4. Process observation data for analysis

Status URL:
